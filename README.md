Booked (formerly phpScheduleIt) Python API Client Library by abdelkafiahmed@yahoo.fr

This is a simple to use Python client/wrapper library inspired by <a href='https://github.com/TrueSerenity/booked-php-api-client'>booked-php-api-cliente</a> to be used with Booked (formerly phpScheduleIt) RESTful API by nick@twinkletoessoftware.com found at <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpscheduleit'>Booked Home</a>.
Please report any bugs or suggestions to <a href="mailto:abdelkafiahmed@yahoo.fr">abdelkafiahmed@yahoo.fr</a> or feel free to create an issue on GitHub.

If you run into trouble, first try visiting your Booked API web URL. If Booked is configured correctly you will see the API documentation page. The URL 
is http://your-booked-domain.com/Web/Services/index.php. If you get an error or can't see the page, you must fix your Booked configuration, otherwise this client will not work.
